## Emergency Department Analysis

### Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of emergency department (ED) data using Power BI. The dataset includes patient visits, outcomes, arrival modes, and other critical metrics related to ED operations across multiple hospitals. The goal is to identify key trends, inefficiencies, and potential areas for improvement in healthcare services.

### Files Included
- Emergency Department.xlsx: Contains raw data related to ED operations, including patient demographics, visit details, outcomes, and hospital information.
- Health_ED_PowerBI.pbix: A Power BI dashboard that visualizes the ED data, providing insights into patient flow, hospital efficiency, and outcomes.

### Data Sources and Structure
### Excel File: Emergency Department.xlsx
The Excel file includes multiple sheets with the following key data points:
- Departure_Code: Information on different departure statuses of patients from the ED.
- ED_Outcome: Descriptions and codes for patient outcomes after an ED visit.
- Hospital: Details about the hospitals included in the analysis.
- Patient Visit Data: Patient visit records with data on arrival mode, presenting problems, treatment times, and demographics.

### Power BI File: Health_ED_PowerBI.pbix
The Power BI dashboard includes several interactive visuals, such as:
- Patient Flow Analysis: Trends in patient visits over time, categorized by hospital, arrival mode, and outcomes.
- Hospital Performance: Comparative analysis of ED efficiency metrics across different hospitals.
- Outcome Trends: Breakdown of patient outcomes, including admissions, discharges, and transfers.

### Instructions
1. Download Files: Download both the Excel file (Emergency Department.xlsx) and the Power BI file (Health_ED_PowerBI.pbix).
2. Open in Power BI: Open the Health_ED_PowerBI.pbix file in Power BI Desktop. Ensure that the Excel file is in the same directory or update the data source path in Power BI if needed.
3. Explore the Dashboard: Navigate through the different tabs in the Power BI report to explore the various insights.

### Key Insights
- Peak Hours and Patient Load: Analysis of peak visiting hours and patient load, helping to optimize staffing and resource allocation.
- Outcome Analysis: Insights into patient outcomes, with a focus on improving treatment protocols and reducing wait times.
- Hospital Comparison: Comparative performance metrics across different hospitals, highlighting areas where specific hospitals excel or lag.
